Description
Replica of the M3 Army and Airforce that the Nazis used in WWII. The simulator tries to keep a similar feel to the real enigma machine, compartments open and close, etc. It can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages with given settings. The goal is to use this to encrypt messages and create Alan Turing's Bombe machine to crack the messages. The Bombe will be created in JavaScript like the enigma machine was created in. The code for the enigma machine will be the foundation of the Bombe (solved with cribs and plugboard contradictions).

How it Works?
Enigma machine details
General details can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine
More specific details at http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmatech.htm
Simulation details
All the individual components are matched to be the same as a real enigma
The machine simulates the current running thru each component
Key -> Plugboard -> Rotor 1 -> R2 -> R3 -> Reflector -> R3 -> R2 -> R1 -> P -> Lamp
How to Use it?
Encrypting
Type the message on the key board (make sure to only click one key at a time)
Only letters from A-Z and "space" will be encrypted ("space" -> X)
Settings
Rotor positions can be changed from the outside of the machine by scrolling on the letter with the mouse wheel
By opening the inside compartment, rotors can be swapped by clicking on them
Each rotor's ring setting can be changed by clicking on the rotor
Reflectors can be swapped by clicking on it
By opening the front compartment, plugs can be connected on the plugboard
